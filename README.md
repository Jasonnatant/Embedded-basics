# Embedded-basics
Foundational embedded systems experiments and notes.

The goal is to build a foundation in:
-Microcontrollers and hardware interaction
-Embedded C/C++
-GP10, timer and interrupts
-Sensors and peripherals
-Debugging and testing 

This project documents my early embedded systems work as i continue developing more advance C/C++ and microcontroller based projects.
